#Run the symbol tagger over our own english text in the Thoughts as well. Otherwise, everytime I add a new symbol type I have to go
#over all my old thoughts and see if this new symbol should be attached to them as well.

""" TODOS """
#person.recent_thoughts is currently just the english text and not the actual Thought.

#make 'salient_action_selector' a property of person.py? Think about how action selectors will be handled by people. Will
#they just have one action selector they work on at a time? Multiple? Will some be foregrounded but others backgrounded?

#CHECK IF NPCs NOTICE THE SONG CHANGE, HAVE OPINIONS ABOUT THE SONG (have they encountered it before?!).
